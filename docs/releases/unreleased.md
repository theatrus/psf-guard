- PSF Guard checks darks and dark-flats sent by remote upload for stray light
  once uploads pause for two minutes, as it does after an import; before,
  they waited for the next server start. The calibration library shows each
  measured dark's level and spread, in ADU.
- Every stack and master rebuilds once, the first time each is used, after
  the move to Seiza 0.29.
- Automatic import no longer creates projects on its own. Frames for targets
  the catalog does not have wait, and the database's status line offers
  **Review** to preview and import them; **New targets** in its settings
  can leave them out or create projects as before. Scan rules leave
  autofocus frames, tests and other folders out of every import, with exclude
  and include patterns and filters for frames with no image type, no target
  name or a short exposure. A `.psfguardignore` file skips its folder.
