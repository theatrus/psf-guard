## Added

- Director's Catalogs view maps existing source projects and profiles to global
  projects and rigs through an explicit preview and Apply. It shows saved links,
  flags invalid identities and changed profiles, and supports read-only users.

- Director's experimental operator API can preview and apply confirmed catalog
  project/profile links to global projects and rigs. It preserves catalog
  identity across moves and retries without changing TS history or image grades.
  Acquisition remains unavailable.

- Director's experimental API can inspect registered catalogs for projects and
  profile IDs, reporting missing or duplicate identities without modifying the
  source database or reading image data.

- An experimental Director page manages global projects, sites, and rigs on
  servers with Director metadata enabled. It supports read-only accounts,
  paged listings, and revision-checked renames without requiring a catalog.

- An opt-in Director metadata API can create, list, and rename global project,
  site and rig identities, and retain complete immutable horizon and equipment
  snapshots in a separate SQLite store. Enable it with `--director-meta` and
  database management on a CLI server. It follows user authentication and does
  not yet enable pairing or acquisition. See `docs/DIRECTOR.md`.

- The server is an **MCP server** at `/api/mcp`, so an agent such as
  Claude Code can list catalogs, read grades and quality evidence, score
  sequences, apply grades, and start imports, quality scans and WBPP runs.
  Write tools follow the caller's role, and the WBPP tools follow the
  database-management gate as the UI does. See `docs/MCP.md`.
- **API tokens** for scripts and MCP clients: mint one under **Settings →
  Users → API tokens** or with `psf-guard users token create`, send it as
  `Authorization: Bearer psfg_…`. A token acts as its user, can be made
  read only or given an expiry, and is shown once. Revoke it in the same
  place or with `users token revoke`; removing a user revokes their tokens.
