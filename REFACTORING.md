# Code Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The codebase has been refactored from a single monolithic `main.rs` file (~1100 lines) into a well-organized modular structure. This improves maintainability, testability, and code organization.

## New Structure

```
src/
├── main.rs           # Entry point (71 lines)
├── cli.rs            # CLI structure and argument parsing
├── models.rs         # Shared data models
├── utils.rs          # Utility functions
├── grading.rs        # Statistical grading module (unchanged)
└── commands/         # Command implementations
    ├── mod.rs
    ├── dump_grading.rs
    ├── filter_rejected.rs
    ├── list_projects.rs
    ├── list_targets.rs
    └── regrade.rs
```

## Key Changes

### 1. Extracted CLI Structure (`cli.rs`)
- Moved all clap-related structures
- Created `StatisticalOptions` struct to share statistical grading options between commands
- Added `to_grading_config()` method to convert CLI options to grading config

### 2. Shared Models (`models.rs`)
- `Project`, `Target`, `AcquiredImage` structs
- `GradingStatus` enum with conversion method

### 3. Utility Functions (`utils.rs`)
- `truncate_string()`: String truncation for display
- `extract_filename()`: Extract filename from JSON metadata

### 4. Command Modules (`commands/`)
Each command is now in its own module:
- **dump_grading.rs**: Query and display grading results
- **list_projects.rs**: List all projects
- **list_targets.rs**: List targets for a project
- **filter_rejected.rs**: Move rejected files to LIGHT_REJECT directories
- **regrade.rs**: Update database with statistical grading

### 5. Simplified Main (`main.rs`)
- Now only handles command routing
- Clean match statement for each command
- Database connection handled per command

## Benefits

1. **Modularity**: Each command is self-contained
2. **Reusability**: Shared code is properly extracted
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific functionality
4. **Testability**: Individual modules can be unit tested
5. **Clarity**: Clear separation of concerns

## Migration Notes

- No functionality was changed, only code organization
- All existing commands work exactly as before
- The grading module was left unchanged as it was already well-organized
- Database queries remain parameterized for security

## Future Improvements

1. **Error Handling**: Could create a custom error type
2. **Database Module**: Extract common database operations
3. **Configuration**: Add config file support
4. **Testing**: Add unit tests for each module
5. **Documentation**: Add module-level documentation
