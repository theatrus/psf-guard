# CLAUDE.md - Development Notes

## Project Overview

PSF Guard is a Rust CLI utility for analyzing N.I.N.A. Target Scheduler databases and managing astronomical image files. Features N.I.N.A. star detection algorithm, PSF fitting, and React web interface.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Development
cargo fmt && cargo clippy && cargo test

# CLI mode - Run server (supports multiple directories)
cargo run -- server db.sqlite images1/ images2/

# GUI mode - Launch desktop app (with tauri feature)
cargo run --features tauri

# Tauri desktop development
cargo tauri dev

# Build for production
cargo build --release                    # CLI only
cargo build --release --features tauri   # GUI capable
```

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **CLI**: Command-pattern with clap-derive (`src/cli_main.rs`)
- **Tauri Desktop**: Desktop app with server integration (`src/tauri_main.rs`)
- **Database**: SQLite via rusqlite
- **Star Detection**: N.I.N.A. algorithm + HocusFocus detector
- **Web Server**: Axum + embedded React frontend
- **Cache System**: Directory tree + file cache with 5-minute TTL

### Multi-database support (2026-05)
The server can manage many N.I.N.A. scheduler databases at once. Both the
Tauri app and the CLI `server` command read from a shared JSON registry at
the platform config location (`<config>/psf-guard/config.json` by default).

- **Registry**: `src/db_registry.rs` owns the on-disk schema (v2). Each entry
  is `{ id, name, db_path, image_dirs }` where `id` is a user-editable
  URL-safe slug seeded from a hash of the canonical DB path. Migration from
  v1 (`{database_path, image_directories}`) happens on first load and writes
  a `.bak`.
- **Server state**: `AppState.databases` is a `HashMap<slug, Arc<DatabaseContext>>`.
  Each context owns its own SQLite connection, directory tree cache, file
  cache, and refresh mutex.
- **API**: every per-DB endpoint is nested under `/api/db/{db_id}/...`.
  Cross-DB endpoints (`/api/info`, `/api/databases`, and CRUD on
  `/api/databases/{id}`) sit at the top level.
- **Frontend model**: no "active DB" switcher. The Overview merges projects
  and targets across all configured databases, grouping by DB. Scoped views
  (grid, detail, comparison) read `?db=<slug>` from the URL alongside the
  other identifiers; missing `?db=` shows an empty state.
- **Per-DB cache**: artifacts live under `<cache_root>/<slug>/`. Slug rename
  via `PUT /api/databases/{id}` renames the cache subdirectory too so
  previously generated previews carry over.
- **CLI persistence**: `psf-guard server <db> <dirs>` registers the DB into
  the shared registry on first run. Use `--registry /tmp/scratch.json` for
  ad-hoc sessions that should not touch the user's real config.

Implementation tracker and design rationale: [MULTI_DB_PLAN.md](./MULTI_DB_PLAN.md).

### Seiza astrometry and sky overlays (2026-07)
- **Header/catalog path**: `GET /api/db/{db_id}/images/{image_id}/astrometry`
  reads only FITS headers, performs coordinate-only object association, and
  returns embedded TAN WCS geometry when present. It also reloads a valid
  persisted pixel-derived solution.
- **On-demand solve**: `POST` to the same endpoint decodes pixels, detects
  stars with Seiza's MTF/u8 path (linear f32 fallback), tries a 2° hinted
  solve when FITS/mount coordinates and scale exist, then uses the blind index
  when installed. One memory-heavy solve runs per database at a time.
- **Persistence**: hinted/blind results are written atomically below
  `<cache_root>/<db_slug>/astrometry/<image_id>.json`. Source-file,
  object-catalog, Seiza-version, and star-catalog fingerprints invalidate
  stale entries; embedded WCS remains authoritative.
- **Coordinates**: Target Scheduler stores RA in decimal hours. Convert it to
  ICRS degrees at the astrometry boundary before computing target offsets or
  drift.
- **Frontend**: coordinate-only results expose `Solve field`; `O` starts the
  solve when needed and otherwise toggles the `@seiza/astro-overlay` renderer.
  Successful solves automatically enable the overlay.
- **Tests**: `static/e2e/image-astrometry.spec.ts` uses an untouched real FITS
  acquisition frame plus a checked-in Tycho-2 subset to require a real solve,
  persistent reload, rendered object overlay, and keyboard toggling.

### Satellite track prediction (2026-07)
- **Boundary**: `src/satellites.rs` uses Seiza 0.9 and
  `seiza-satellites 0.1` to predict named orbital crossings through one solved
  exposure. `association = predicted_not_pixel_detected` is intentional:
  never present a catalog prediction as a trail found in image pixels.
- **Inputs**: a solved WCS, UTC shutter bounds (`DATE-BEG`/`DATE-OBS` plus
  `DATE-END` or `EXPTIME`), and a topocentric site from FITS headers.
- **Network/cache**: only `POST /api/db/{id}/images/{image_id}/satellites`
  may refresh CelesTrak. Quality scans and CLI regrading use
  `cached_for_exposure()` and never download: Seiza selects the durable
  timestamped snapshot nearest each shutter interval. Shared elements live at
  `<cache>/satellites`, persist up to the dependency's 5 GiB default bound,
  and carry a payload SHA-256 into each result. Per-image predictions live at
  `<cache>/<db>/satellites/<image_id>.json` and are invalidated by source
  fingerprint, exact WCS, or dependency/alignment version.
- **Pixel evidence**: use `seiza_satellites::trail_alignment`; do not recreate
  the matcher in PSF Guard. It evaluates the complete clipped polyline in
  physical ADU and distinguishes `not_detected` from `not_evaluated` when less
  than half the path has usable sideband coverage.
- **UI/grading**: `T` predicts or toggles labeled track geometry. Possible
  bright risk warns/caps score at 0.75; high risk caps at 0.35 and supplies a
  reviewed `[Auto]` rejection reason. Risk is an illumination/range/elevation/
  path-length heuristic, not apparent magnitude or pixel evidence.

### Out-of-tree reject archive (2026-05)
- **Command**: `psf-guard move-rejects --db <slug>` (multi-DB-aware via the
  registry). Moves files marked `gradingStatus = 2` to
  `<image_dir>/<P>/REJECT/<rest>` by default, plus same-stem sidecars
  (`.xisf`, `.json`, `.txt` by default). Idempotent across re-runs. Files
  stay findable in the web UI — the directory tree indexes the REJECT
  subtree and resolves previews by basename. `--dry-run` performs no DB
  writes (the `psf_guard_archive` table is not even created).
- **Restore**: `psf-guard restore-rejects --db <slug>` reverses a move. By
  default restores only rows whose current grade is no longer `Rejected`
  (un-rejected in the UI, to Accepted *or* Pending); `--all` /
  `--image-id` / `--guid` override that. Never overwrites — restores
  beside an occupant with a `.restored[.N]` suffix. Deletes the archive
  row and prunes emptied REJECT dirs (a dir still holding the manifest is
  kept).
- **State**: a `psf_guard_archive` sibling table in the same SQLite file
  records each move, keyed on `acquiredimage.guid` (TS plugin migration
  22). The plan deliberately avoids stamping the upstream `metadata`
  JSON column (TS's `ImageMetadata` DTO drops unknown keys on
  round-trip, see plan §3). Each archive root
  (`<image_dir>/<P>/REJECT/.psf-guard-manifest.json`, one per tree — not
  per leaf) also gets a redundant manifest for disaster recovery.
- **Config precedence**: CLI flags > per-DB `reject_archive` block in
  the registry (`segment_name`, `depth`, `sidecar_exts`) > compiled-in
  defaults (`REJECT`, `1`, `[.xisf, .json, .txt]`).
- **Schema requirement**: TS plugin schema v22+ (the `guid` column).
  Older DBs are refused with an actionable error pointing at the
  legacy `filter-rejected` command.
- **Legacy**: `psf-guard filter-rejected <db> <base>` still works
  (still useful for its `--stat-*` statistical-regrading flags) but
  prints a deprecation banner pointing at `move-rejects`.

Design, phases, tracker: [REJECT_ARCHIVE_PLAN.md](./REJECT_ARCHIVE_PLAN.md).

### Occlusion / cloud screening (2026-07)
- **Spatial metrics**: `src/spatial_analysis.rs` — grid-based (8x6 default)
  per-frame metrics: `star_dead_cell_fraction` (fraction of cells whose star
  density collapsed; from detector star positions, ~free), `star_uniformity`,
  `bg_cell_spread`/`bg_cell_max_dev` (per-cell background medians in physical
  ADU). Rationale: partial occlusion (trees, dome, stray light) leaves global
  star count/HFR within normal variation while killing part of the frame —
  validated on NGC 6820 2026-05/06 sessions where HFR stayed ~2.6 until the
  frame was >60% occluded. Clean-frame envelope across 4 nights/4 filters:
  dead ≤ 0.04, bg_spread ≤ ~0.09.
- **FitsImage ADU calibration**: `from_file` rescales each frame by its own
  min/max, so stored values are NOT comparable across frames. `raw_min`,
  `raw_scale`, `bzero` fields + `stored_to_adu()` recover physical ADU; any
  cross-frame background comparison must use them.
- **Sequence analyzer** (`src/sequence_analysis.rs`): `ImageMetrics` carries
  `dead_cell_fraction` + `bg_cell_spread`; quality score has an absolute
  spatial-coverage component (weight additive, missing-metric-safe for
  DB-only flows); EWMA baseline freezes when a frame's temporal score exceeds
  `baseline_freeze_threshold` and classification baselines skip anomalous
  frames (prevents slow occlusions absorbing into the baseline). The freeze
  is bounded: after `baseline_freeze_max_frames` (default 15) consecutive
  anomalous frames the run is accepted as a new steady state and baselines
  re-seed, so a permanent condition change (moonrise, light dome) cannot
  flag the rest of a session — occluded frames stay penalized via the
  absolute spatial term. Same bounded pattern in `grading.rs`
  `check_cloud_sequence` (re-seeds after `2*cloud_baseline_count`).
  `classify_issues` separates localized occlusion (dead-cell rise →
  `PossibleObstruction`, fires even when the composite score is still good,
  but requires an adjacent frame's dead fraction to corroborate so a
  single-frame blip never rejects) from uniform veiling (`LikelyClouds`)
  and stray-light gradients (bg-spread rise → `SkyBrightening`). Star-grid
  metrics abstain (None) on uniformly sparse frames (narrowband/short subs
  on slow rigs) instead of reporting phantom dead cells.
- **CLI**: `psf-guard screen-fits <dir>` — no DB needed. Detects stars +
  spatial metrics per frame (parallel), groups by (filter, exposure) from
  FITS headers, splits sessions, runs the sequence analyzer, prints per-frame
  verdict OK/WARN/REJECT (`--min-score`, `--dead-cell-rise` strictness,
  `--format table|csv|json`). Occlusion/cloud categories reject regardless of
  composite score; sky-gradient warns (recoverable via gradient removal).
- **DB regrade**: `screen-fits <dir> --regrade-db <slug-or-path> [--dry-run]`
  writes `[Auto] Obstruction/Clouds - score …` rejections for REJECT
  verdicts into the scheduler DB. Matching requires FITS basename AND
  |DATE-OBS − acquireddate| ≤ 10 min (both UTC epoch; observed skew ~1s on
  real N.I.N.A. data), so screening an unrelated directory can never
  regrade the wrong row; ambiguous or timestamp-less matches are skipped
  and counted. Already-Rejected rows untouched — but wrongly Accepted ones
  ARE regraded, since N.I.N.A.'s rolling star-count baseline absorbs slow
  occlusions and accepts frames that are >80% blocked (observed on the real
  DB where 31/33 occluded 06-30 R frames were Accepted). Opens the DB
  READ_WRITE without CREATE so a stale registry path errors instead of
  leaving a junk sqlite file. Rejections then flow through `move-rejects`
  as usual.
- **Photometric screening (2026-07)**: `src/photometry.rs` — cross-frame
  differential photometry + per-cell temporal baselines, for small clouds
  and errant light that grid metrics dilute away. Stars are matched across
  a session (grid-hash NN after estimating the global dither offset) against
  a presence-filtered reference catalog (median flux per star). Signals per
  frame: **transparency** (median matched-star flux ratio; thin uniform
  cloud dims ~10-40% long before stars vanish), **extinction_cell_fraction**
  (per-cell flux ratios ÷ global transparency < 0.75 → localized small
  cloud), **star_cell_drop_fraction** (cell's share of stars vs its own
  temporal median, Poisson floors), **bg_cell_rise_fraction** (plane-
  detrended per-cell background vs temporal median → transient errant
  light; static gradients live in the plane + baseline). Fluxes MUST be
  ADU (`stored_flux / raw_scale`) — stored units are per-frame rescaled.
  Sessions split on the 60-min gap and group by (filter, exposure) before
  matching. **Static glow** (`bg_glow_max` in spatial_analysis): max positive
  residual above the frame's own robust-plane model — catches haze/lit
  occluder edges present from a session's FIRST frame, which every temporal
  detector is structurally blind to. Flag requires BOTH >2.5% of sky AND
  >30 ADU (`glow_min_adu`): real Ha nebulosity measures 19-22 ADU mid-frame
  (4-5% of dark narrowband sky) and must not flag; measured haze is 48-103
  ADU at field edges. WARN-only (SkyBrightening) — glow frames stack into
  artifacts, so they surface for pre-integration review. Rig-signature
  cross-series baselining is the robust future extension.
  `screen-fits --annotate <dir>` renders a diagnostic PNG per
  WARN/REJECT frame (`src/commands/screen_annotate.rs`): grid overlay with
  RED = dead cells, ORANGE = localized extinction (labeled with the cell's
  flux ratio), MAGENTA = transient star-share drop, YELLOW = background
  rise, BLUE = background fall (dark occluder), CYAN = static glow, plus a
  caption strip (verdict/score/metrics/details, built-in
  bitmap font — no font-file dependency). Classification: localized extinction / star-cell drop →
  `LikelyClouds` (small cloud, REJECT; single-frame allowed — multi-star
  evidence), transparency < 0.8 → `LikelyClouds` (veil), bg-cell rise with
  stable stars → `SkyBrightening` (errant light, WARN). Quality score gains
  an absolute transparency term (weight 0.15 additive). Wired into BOTH
  `screen-fits` (Transp/Ext% columns) and the server scan
  (`StoredSpatialMetrics` persists a 300-star catalog + per-cell grids;
  `analyze_sequence`/`get_image_quality` run the pass at query time —
  pre-photometry cache entries lack catalogs and simply skip it until a
  re-scan). Photometry is blind to regions occluded most of a sequence
  (reference presence filter) — that remains the dead-cell metric's job.
- **Server/UI trigger**: `src/server/spatial_scan.rs` + `POST
  /api/db/{id}/analysis/quality-scan` runs spatial/photometric analysis and
  fresh pixel-derived astrometry as a
  singleton per-DB background task (~8s/frame full-frame) over a target's
  FITS files (paths via `find_fits_file`). Worker count is sized by
  `concurrency::plan_workers` (see the parallelism note below), not a fixed
  2. Results live in
  `DatabaseContext.spatial_metrics` and persist to
  `<cache_dir>/spatial_metrics.json` (survives restarts; entries invalidated
  by filename change; re-scan skips cached, `force` recomputes).
  `analyze_sequence` + `get_image_quality` merge the stored metrics into
  `ImageMetrics` so the SequenceView gains occlusion classification once a
  scan has run. `/analysis/spatial-scan` remains a compatibility alias.
  Frontend: "Scan Quality" button in SequenceView
  (`useSpatialScan` hook, 1s progress poll, auto-invalidates
  sequence-analysis queries when the scan finishes).

### Astrometry quality grading (2026-07)
- **Acquisition context**: `src/acquisition_context.rs` reads intended target
  center/epoch/rotation/ROI plus per-capture SessionId, guiding, pier side,
  and rotator metadata without assuming every TS schema has every column.
  Direct target fields win over metadata fallbacks. Absolute grading abstains
  for unsupported coordinate epochs. Request paths that iterate a sequence
  MUST use `FramingResolver` (one schema probe + one target query per distinct
  target), never per-image `load()` — per-image PRAGMAs are pathological on
  SMB-mounted scheduler DBs.
- **Pixel evidence only**: quality scans call `solve_image_for_quality`, so an
  embedded FITS WCS can support display but never proves the current pixels
  solve (for display, embedded WCS stays authoritative; the cached pixel
  attempt rides along as evidence). Structured attempts distinguish
  deterministic no-match/too-few-star results from decode, resource,
  cancellation, and internal failures — classified by which solver stages
  actually ran, not by error-string matching. A hinted no-match on a rig
  without a blind index IS deterministic evidence; its cached failure is
  invalidated (and retried) once a blind index is installed. Only
  deterministic attempts are persisted as image-quality evidence. The per-DB
  solve mutex is taken per image, so on-demand solves interleave with a
  running scan. Sequence requests read evidence through the per-DB
  `AstrometryEvidenceCache` (parsed JSON keyed by cache-file mtime — N stats
  instead of N parses per request); the FITS source fingerprint is still
  verified on every lookup so a replaced acquisition file invalidates its
  evidence immediately.
- **Sequence grading**: `AstrometryFrameMetrics` feeds tangent-plane target
  offsets, robust solved-center references, jump detection, and Theil-Sen
  drift into the existing score. Missing astrometry renormalizes away.
  OffTarget requires departing from BOTH the intended target (>=20% of the
  short field) and the segment's own robust cluster — a consistently
  displaced segment is `StableOffset`: deliberate framing, warned, scored on
  its residual from the segment center, never auto-rejected (plan §8). A
  target outside the solved footprint is OffTarget regardless of stability
  and caps score at 0.20; confirmed jump/drift caps at 0.30. Jumps are
  detected over runs of consecutive excursions (bounded by well-behaved
  frames, spanning <half the solves), so a multi-frame tracking loss that
  recovers flags every affected frame. An isolated no-solve is a warning and
  modest score signal, never an automatic rejection by itself.
- **Regrading**: SequenceView exposes Off Target, Unsolved, and Recommended
  selectors plus a per-image review dialog; confirming writes each image's
  OWN `regrade_reason` (batched per distinct reason), not one collapsed
  string. `screen-fits --regrade-db` enables fresh solves after the
  basename+timestamp DB match and uses the same sequence decisions; CSV
  output carries SolveState/OffsetFieldFraction/RegradeReason columns.
  Off-target/jump/drift or a deterministic no-solve corroborated by
  cloud/obstruction/tracking evidence receives a specific `[Auto]` reason;
  operational failures, isolated no-solves, and stable offsets do not
  regrade.

### Worker-pool parallelism policy (2026-07)
All CPU-bound parallel work is sized through `src/concurrency.rs` instead of
hardcoded caps. The per-frame work (FITS load → star detection →
`compute_spatial_metrics` / stretch-to-PNG) is single-threaded internally, so
the lever is how many frames run at once.
- **`WorkerPolicy`** groups the tunables: `interactive_ratio` (default 0.5),
  `background_ratio` (default 0.25), `memory_budget_fraction` (0.5),
  `hard_max_workers` (64), `peak_bytes_per_pixel` (32). Threads through
  `ServerConfig` → `AppState` → the scan handler as one value.
- **`plan_workers(requested, &policy, priority, frame_pixels)`** →
  `WorkerBudget { workers, rationale }`. An explicit `--threads` override wins
  (clamped to `[1, hard_max]`); otherwise `round(cores * ratio_for(priority))`,
  then capped by `memory_budget_fraction * available_RAM / (frame_pixels *
  peak_bytes_per_pixel)` when the frame size + RAM are known. `frame_pixels`
  comes from `probe_frame_pixels` (reads NAXIS1×NAXIS2 without loading data).
- **Memory probe** `available_memory_bytes()`: Linux `/proc/meminfo`
  MemAvailable, macOS `sysctl hw.memsize` (libc), Windows `GlobalMemoryStatusEx`
  (windows-sys). `None` → skip the memory cap.
- **`parallel_index(len, workers, f)`** is the shared atomic work-stealing pool
  both the CLI `screen-fits` and server scan use.
- **Priority + yielding**: interactive work (server "Scan Occlusion", CLI
  `screen-fits`) uses `Priority::Interactive`; the server scan holds an
  `AppState::begin_interactive_job()` guard for its lifetime. Background image
  pre-generation uses `Priority::Background` (fewer cores) AND pauses whenever
  `AppState::interactive_job_active()` — so a user-triggered scan gets the
  cores and memory, and background pre-warming resumes when it's idle.
- **Config** (`[server]` in the TOML `--config`): `scan_worker_ratio` →
  interactive, `background_worker_ratio` → background. Both optional, clamped
  to `[0.05, 1.0]`, absent → compiled-in defaults.

### Async on-demand preview generation (2026-07)
Preview/annotated PNGs are no longer generated inside the request. `src/server/preview_queue.rs`
holds a process-global `PreviewQueue` on `AppState`: on a cache miss the
preview/annotated handlers `enqueue_preview(GenJob)` and return **HTTP 202**
`{state:"generating"}` immediately (never blocking the `<img>` GET). The queue
is a bounded, `Priority::Interactive` pool (semaphore sized lazily via
`plan_workers` + a frame probe) where each job holds a
`begin_interactive_job()` guard, so background pre-generation yields to
user-driven preview work. Dedup is by full `cache_path`; generation writes to
a temp file then atomically renames, so a readiness poll never sees a partial
PNG (the pregen paths in `mod.rs` do the same now).
- **Batch status**: `POST /api/db/{id}/images/generation-status` takes
  `{requests:[{image_id,kind,size,stretch?,midtone?,shadow?,max_stars?}]}` and
  returns parallel `{state: ready|generating|error}` — coalesces a whole grid's
  polling into one request; enqueues unknown items idempotently.
- **Cache keys**: `preview_cache_key` / `annotated_cache_key` in `handlers.rs`
  are shared by the artifact handler, the status endpoint, and pregen so all
  address the same file.
- **Slow-storage isolation (2026-07)**: measured against an SMB-mounted
  scheduler DB (274MB, journal=delete) where every SQLite transaction pays
  network lock round-trips (30-80s/query observed). Two rules keep the
  request path responsive there: (1) the background file-check refresh runs
  all its queries on a **dedicated connection** (one `get_images_by_project_id`
  per project, per-target tallies grouped in memory — never the old
  full-table scan per target), so the shared request-connection mutex is
  never held by a slow refresh query; (2) `get_directory_tree` **never scans
  in the request path** when any tree exists — a stale (>5min) tree is served
  immediately while one deduped background thread revalidates; only a cold
  start blocks, and concurrent cold callers share a single scan.
- **Frontend** (`static/src`): optimistic `<img>` + poll-on-error. `hooks/previewPoll.ts`
  is a singleton coordinator that batches pending descriptors (per DB) into one
  `getGenerationStatus` POST every ~800ms; `hooks/useAsyncImage.ts` drives an
  `<img>` (renders directly on a cache hit — zero extra requests; on the 202
  error joins the poller, shows "Generating…", reloads with a cache-buster when
  ready). `components/PreviewImage.tsx` wraps grid/sequence images;
  `ImageDetailView`/`ImageComparisonView` use the hook directly (preserving the
  zoom transforms), and `ensurePreviewReady` replaces the `new Image()` zoom-
  switch preloads + `useImagePreloader` warming so an uncached 'original'
  actually generates before the zoom swaps to it.
- **Detail-view zoom model (2026-07)**: `useImageZoom` keeps `stateDimsRef` —
  the dimensions the transform is *calibrated against* — and constrains pans
  and fits against that, never the live `<img>.naturalWidth` (which lags a src
  swap; clamping original-image offsets against the old preview's dims is what
  threw the viewport to the top-left mid-gesture). `ImageDetailView` tracks a
  `'fit' | 'user'` view mode via the hook's `onViewModeChange` (wheel / +/- /
  100% / pan → `'user'`; F / Fit / 0 → `'fit'`; no time-based cooldown
  heuristics). Every `onLoad` reports through `applyBitmapDimensions(w, h,
  mode)`: `'fit'` refits centered; `'preserve'` keeps the state EXACTLY when
  dims are unchanged (arrow-key navigation ⇒ identical scale/offsets/percent)
  and remaps to the same displayed size + center when they differ (preview ↔
  original swaps). The original switch triggers on RAW scale (`>0.8` preload,
  once per image; `>=1.0` swap) — raw `scale > 1` means the current bitmap is
  upscaled past its native pixels, whichever size is showing. The zoom
  percentage is relative to the ORIGINAL's pixels (learned from metadata or
  the first original load; falls back to raw until known). ImageComparisonView
  keeps its own working preservation logic — don't "unify" it into this model
  without re-testing both — but every loaded bitmap MUST be reported to the
  hook (comparison calls `notifyBitmapDimensions` in its onLoads; detail goes
  through `applyBitmapDimensions`): constraints follow `stateDimsRef`, not the
  live `<img>`, so an unreported load leaves pans clamped against the previous
  image's dimensions.

### Two-DB sync (2026-06)
Lives in `src/commands/sync/` (`mod.rs` shared helpers + `grades.rs` + `pull.rs`).
Two complementary single-direction kinds, structured as `sync <kind>` so more
kinds slot in without breaking the CLI. Both match by `guid` (TS schema v22+),
accept a registry slug *or* a raw `.sqlite` path for `--from`/`--to` (registry
loaded only when a side isn't already a file), open source READ_ONLY / dest
READ_WRITE, refuse same-path source/dest, and have `--dry-run` + `--verbose`.

**`sync grades --from <our> --to <telescope>`** — push grading state.
- Pushes `gradingStatus` + `rejectreason` one-way; source wins. Match by
  `acquiredimage.guid`, guard via `require_target_scheduler_guid`.
- `--status pending|accepted|rejected` scopes source rows; `--project` /
  `--target` substring filters. One transaction (`batch_update_grading_status`),
  reuses `query_images` for both sides.
- Reports considered / matched / changed / unchanged / unmatched-source /
  dest-only + per-transition breakdown. NULL/empty and within-DB-duplicate guids
  skipped (counted, not fatal).

**`sync pull --from <telescope> --to <our>`** — pull structure + captures.
- Mirrors `exposuretemplate`, `project`, `ruleweight`, `target`, `exposureplan`,
  `acquiredimage`, and `imagedata` blobs (copied by default; `--no-image-data`
  to skip) into our DB.
  Processed in FK order, building `src_guid → dest_Id` maps so child FKs
  (target→project, plan→target+template, image→project+target+exposureId,
  ruleweight→project) are remapped onto the destination's local autoincrement
  Ids. Generic guid-keyed upsert reads all columns via `pragma_table_info` so it
  survives TS schema additions; `ruleweight` (no guid) matches by
  `(projectId, name)`; `imagedata` is insert-only.
- **Telescope wins for structure** (upsert: insert new, update changed fields —
  project state, plan desired/acquired counts, coordinates). **Local grading is
  preserved**: a new image takes the telescope grade; an existing image keeps
  its grade unless still Pending (0), in which case it adopts the telescope's
  grade. Guard via `require_pull_capable` (guid on all 5 core tables).
- `--project <substr>` scopes the pull (cascades to that project's targets,
  plans, images; templates always synced so plan FKs resolve). Whole pull runs
  in one transaction, rolled back on `--dry-run`.
- Reports per-table inserted/updated/unchanged plus grades filled/preserved.

### Smart Binary Mode Selection
- **Single binary** `psf-guard` with intelligent mode detection
- **GUI mode**: When tauri feature is enabled and no arguments passed → Desktop app launches
- **CLI mode**: When arguments are provided OR tauri feature is disabled → Command-line interface
- `src/main.rs`: Smart dispatcher that checks for arguments to determine mode
- `src/cli_main.rs`: Traditional command-line interface implementation
- `src/tauri_main.rs`: Tauri desktop application implementation

#### Dedicated CLI binary + Windows installer (2026-07)
- **`src/bin/psf-guard-cli.rs`**: a second bin target that just calls
  `cli_main::main()` and never sets `windows_subsystem = "windows"`, so it stays
  a **console** app. Needed because the `tauri`-feature release `psf-guard.exe`
  is a GUI-subsystem binary (`main.rs` `#![cfg_attr(... windows_subsystem =
  "windows")]`): dual-mode, but its stdout/stderr don't attach to a terminal on
  Windows, making it a poor CLI. The standalone `psf-guard-*-x64` release assets
  are built from this target (`cargo build --bin psf-guard-cli`, no tauri) —
  `cargo tauri build` overwrites `target/release/psf-guard`, so the standalone
  CLI must come from the separate bin. Having two bins requires
  `default-run = "psf-guard"` (Cargo.toml) + `"mainBinaryName": "psf-guard"`
  (tauri.conf.json) so `cargo run` and the Tauri bundler pick the app binary,
  not the sidecar — otherwise Tauri bundles `psf-guard-cli` as the app (WiX
  ICE30 duplicate-component error on Windows; a broken GUI elsewhere).
- **Installer bundles it automatically**: Tauri bundles *every* cargo `[[bin]]`
  target, so `psf-guard-cli.exe` ships next to the GUI app in the MSI + NSIS
  (and in the macOS `.app` / Linux packages) with **no `externalBin`** — an
  explicit `externalBin` would duplicate it and trip WiX ICE30. The only
  Windows-specific bundle config is the NSIS PATH hook in
  `tauri.bundle-windows.json`, applied at the bundle step via `cargo tauri build
  --config tauri.bundle-windows.json`. Do NOT name that file
  `tauri.windows.conf.json`: Tauri auto-merges `tauri.<platform>.conf.json` into
  *every* tauri-feature compile (`build.rs` → `tauri_build::build()`), which
  needlessly couples plain `clippy --all-features`/`cargo build --features tauri`
  to bundle config.
- **NSIS adds it to PATH**: `nsis/hooks.nsh` (`bundle.windows.nsis.installerHooks`)
  appends the install dir to the **per-user** `HKCU\Environment` PATH on install
  and removes it on uninstall (StrFunc dedup, `WM_WININICHANGE` broadcast), so
  `psf-guard-cli` runs from any terminal. Per-user because Tauri's default NSIS
  installMode is per-user (no elevation, short PATH, clean revert). The **MSI**
  bundles the CLI but does **not** modify PATH yet (WiX `<Environment>` is a
  possible follow-up; it can only be validated in Windows CI). Hook syntax is
  locally checkable with `makensis` against a Tauri-shaped harness.

### Cache System (Current)
- **File Cache**: Database-based existence checking, auto-refreshed every 5 minutes
- **Directory Tree**: In-memory filename→path mapping, auto-refreshed every 5 minutes
- **Singleton Refresh**: Non-blocking with real-time progress tracking via SSE
- **Manual Refresh**: Button (file cache) + Shift+click (both caches)
- **Multi-Directory**: Scans multiple directories with first-hit preference

## Database Schema

```sql
project (1:many) → target (1:many) → acquiredimage

acquiredimage:
- gradingStatus: 0=Pending, 1=Accepted, 2=Rejected
- metadata: JSON with FileName
```

**Column naming**: Use exact case - `Id`, `projectId`, `acquireddate`, `filtername`

## Web Server

### Frontend Architecture
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- TanStack Query for server state
- Hash router with URL state management
- Embedded in binary for single-file deployment

### Navigation Fix (2025-09-01)
Fixed overview→grid navigation by building URLs directly:
- `navigate('/grid?project=5')` instead of state coordination
- Eliminates race conditions and timing issues
- Works for projects, targets, and "all projects"

## Key Features

### Web UI
- Smart image loading (preview → full resolution)
- Batch operations with multi-selection
- Undo/redo system (Ctrl+Z/Y)  
- Side-by-side comparison with zoom sync
- Real-time cache refresh with progress tracking

### Cache Progress UI (2025-09-01)
- Smart path truncation showing distinctive parts
- Pulsating progress indicator with integrated timer
- Fixed dimensions to prevent layout shifts
- Hover tooltips for full paths

## Development Workflow

```bash
# Essential commands
cargo fmt && cargo clippy && cargo test

# Run with logging
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run -- server db.sqlite images/

# Browser end-to-end (Playwright) — drives the embedded React UI against
# a real `psf-guard server` instance with --allow-database-management.
# Requires a built release binary; specs live under static/e2e/.
cd static && npm run test:e2e

# Tauri desktop development
cargo tauri dev

# Frontend development  
cd static && npm run dev

# OpenCV setup (macOS)
brew install opencv
# For Command Line Tools:
export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH="/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/lib"
# For Xcode.app:
# export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH="/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib"
```

### Tauri Desktop Configuration
- **Settings Panel**: Configure database and image directories via native file dialogs
- **System Directory Structure**: Uses platform-appropriate directories for all data:
  - **Configuration**: 
    - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/psf-guard/config.json`
    - Windows: `%APPDATA%\psf-guard\config.json`
    - Linux: `~/.config/psf-guard/config.json`
  - **Cache**: 
    - macOS: `~/Library/Caches/psf-guard/`
    - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\psf-guard\cache\`
    - Linux: `~/.cache/psf-guard/`
  - **Temp Database** (when no N.I.N.A. database found):
    - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/psf-guard/temp.db`
    - Windows: `%APPDATA%\psf-guard\temp.db`
    - Linux: `~/.local/share/psf-guard/temp.db`
- **Smart Settings Modal**: Only appears on first launch or when configuration is invalid/missing
- **Configuration Updates**: Settings saved immediately, with user-friendly restart prompt to apply changes  
- **Automatic Loading**: Configuration loaded and validated on application startup
- **Directory Management**: All directories are automatically created as needed
- **Database Validation**: Checks that configured database file actually exists before considering config valid

### Development Notes
- **Important**: Remove `static/dist/` contents if Tauri detection fails - cached production assets may be served instead of dev server
- File picker commands are async to prevent UI freezing
- Application restart applies configuration changes cleanly without data loss

### Recent Fixes
- **Navigation**: Direct URL building eliminates timing issues
- **Cache Progress**: Real-time directory scanning with smart path display
- **Multi-Directory**: Priority-based file lookup with comprehensive caching

## Key Implementation Details

### Star Detection
- N.I.N.A. algorithm port with MTF stretching
- Optional OpenCV integration (`--features opencv`)
- PSF fitting: Gaussian/Moffat models

### Performance
- O(1) file lookups via directory tree cache
- Non-blocking server startup with background refresh
- Comprehensive cache key strategy prevents collisions
